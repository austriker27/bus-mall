# bus-mall
Its like SkyMall, but better.

BusMall is an application that provides a focus group member (aka user) with 3 randomly generated images. These images are from a product list and will be regenerated when the page is clicked. Also clicks are tracked and the page will display a list of click totals per item after 25 clicks.

## For Developers

Need a catalog of the products you want to show in the page.
There's a constructor for the image list that show up in the page.
